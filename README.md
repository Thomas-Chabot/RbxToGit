# RbxToGit

## Purpose
RbxToGit is a simple application for copying scripts made within Roblox onto your local computer (which can then be saved onto GitHub).

## Requirements
For the app to work, NodeJS (along with npm) must be installed onto your computer.

This must also work in conjunction with the Roblox Studio plugin (see the RbxToGit-Plugin repository for details, https://github.com/Thomas-Chabot/RbxToGit-Plugin)

## Installation
The easiest way to install the RbxToGit application is through npm. This can be done with the following command:

`npm install rbxtogit -g`

## Usage
RbxToGit can be run through the `rbxtogit` terminal command. This should be called from within the same directory as scripts should be saved.

The application will then wait for requests from the Studio plugin, after which the Roblox game scripts will be created in your local system.
